              Are you satisfied with yourself? Have you exceeded the measure of
              self-awareness? These are questions that most people ask
              themselves at some point in their lives. For a considerable
              period, many people tend to avoid these questions and opt for
              distractions such as insomnia. Answering these questions is
              challenging because once you start delving into them, you confront
              the fundamental rule: 'Show me, tell me how sleepy you are.' This
              signal serves as a reminder to recognize whether you have the
              desire to improve and evolve mentally and physically. In this
              article, we will discuss this topic in detail and provide you with
              numbers that most people want to hear. We won't keep you lost;
              instead, we'll go into detail! Stick with me, and by the end of
              the article, you'll be more motivated to return, show yourself,
              and work on the methods we've outlined for you. If you're up for
              it, follow and focus on each point we discuss. The article is
              divided into four sections.

              The third section will provide the number of sets that you can do
              for each muscle per week to avoid exceeding the measure in
              training. Less is more in training, especially when it comes to
              surpassing the measure.

              What is the exercise volume?

            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              The exercise volume, in short, is the result of this equation
              (weight × number of repetitions × number of sets). Let's take an
              example with the squat exercise for better understanding. For
              instance, in this exercise, we do 3 sets, and each set consists of
              ten repetitions. If we can lift 60 kilograms in each set, then (60
              × 10 × 3 = 1800).

          <div className='mt-4'>
            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg'>
              In short, the exercise volume, which we achieved here, is
              represented by this equation (weight × number of repetitions ×
              number of sets). Applying this to all the exercises we performed
              in that session, let's say, for example, during leg day, we did 5
              different exercises, each yielding a volume of 1800. So, when we
              multiply these five exercises by 1800, we get a total volume of
              9000! Therefore, on leg day, we worked with a total exercise
              volume of 9000. Now, why bother with these calculations? The
              answer is simple. When you go through that first year, at least,
              your body will enter a phase of rapid muscle building, regardless
              of how you trained it. The key is to consistently provide your
              muscles with more than you gave them in the previous session. This
              is where you need to respect the rule that says if you want your
              muscle to grow continuously, give it more than you gave it in the
              last session. So, pay attention during the session, calculate the
              volume, and in the next session, for that specific muscle, make
              sure you do more than last time. It's that simple, right?!

              How can we increase the volume between each session?
            </h1>
            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              Very easy! Here you have three methods: either increase the number
              of repetitions, or the number of sets, or increase the weight. The
              most important thing is not to recommend increasing the number of
              sets because it's not the best method. Instead, increasing
              repetitions and weight is the best thing you can do, and this is
              what is called "progressive overload.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className='h-auto w-full mt-8'>
            <img src={Img3} alt='' className='w-full' />
          </div>
          <div className='mt-4'>
            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg'>
              So, to clarify the concept further, let's say you can increase a
              bit in each set. For example, you can add half a kilogram or a
              kilogram. Even if you get a little bit, it's okay. Over time, when
              I tell you that your body, in these conditions, recognizes the
              difference, trust me. Let's give you an example for better
              understanding. Suppose on Monday, you have a chest workout with 5
              different exercises, each consisting of 4 sets, and each set has
              10 repetitions. Let's assume the exercise volume came out to be
              10,000. Now, when you go next time to train your chest, you should
              aim to reach, let's say, 10,100 in the exercise volume. So, for
              the first couple of exercises, try to increase the number of
              repetitions or the weight, getting closer to that number you set
              in your mind when you calculated the exercise volume. This way,
              you ensure that your chest is on an upward trajectory. Apply this
              approach to all muscles, both small and large.

              The number of sets you do for each muscle
            </h1>
            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              is relative because it depends on the individual and how each
              person responds to sets. However, the typical range is from 10
              sets per session to 20 sets per session. You might ask, "How do I
              know the right number for me?" Well, I'll tell you: try it out.
              Some people with naturally strong muscles that grow easily may
              need fewer sets, while stubborn muscles might require more sets.
              So, start experimenting until you find the number that suits you.
              The key is not to go below 10 sets and try not to exceed 20 sets
              per week for each muscle. It's essential to find the balance that
              works for you during each week.

              How can we manipulate the exercise volume to achieve the maximum
              possible muscle gain?
            </h1>
            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              There is a technique that people who have succeeded before use, as
              we mentioned earlier, a technique that keeps their muscles
              constantly challenged to grow. They follow a specific training
              program, let's say for six weeks. In the first week, they start
              with just ten sets per muscle per week. Then, in the second week,
              they increase it to twelve sets per muscle per week. After the
              third week, they raise it to fourteen sets per muscle per week,
              and so on until they reach twenty sets per muscle per week. After
              that, they decrease the number of sets gradually while increasing
              the weight that they were lifting in their exercises. They repeat
              the cycle, and this way, they respect the principle of increasing
              the exercise volume in each session. It makes things easier for us
              to follow our progress in addition to the increase in muscle
              strength over time. So, now we've learned what "volume" is, how to
              calculate it, and how to utilize it to achieve the maximum
              possible muscle gain. Now, with this information and these
              numbers, all you have to do is apply them to yourself, experiment,
              correct mistakes, and keep refining until it becomes easy for you.
              Ensure that you are on the right track, and remember, it doesn't
              happen overnight; it's about dedicating time and effort to
              continuously improve and face challenges. This is the beauty of
              this sport - the more we increase, the more we learn, and the more
              we face things that make us reassess, turn around, search, and
              evolve even more!
