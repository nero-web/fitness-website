              As we learned on Fitnessbdarija, the more calories you burn than
              the calories you consume in a day, the more weight you will lose.
              Conversely, if you consume more calories than you burn daily, you
              will gain weight. It's a simple, understandable, and logical
              process. Before delving further into this topic, let's briefly
              touch on the subject of Saber (what are calories) so you can
              understand why they talk about it. Once you understand what
              calories are, we will provide you with the most important things
              you can do, whether you are aware of them or overlooking them, to
              help burn a significant amount of calories.

            <h1 className='text-2xl font-primary font-bold'>Adequate Sleep</h1>
            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              Getting an adequate amount of sleep each day will improve your
              overall life and, specifically, your body, as everything is
              interconnected. Specialists, such as the Rest and Sleep
              Association, recommend that every adult sleeps between six and a
              half to eight and a half hours, with the rate varying for young
              children and adults. This good sleep helps in processing memories
              and brain health on one hand, and it relaxes muscles and organs
              that work during the day on the other hand. Additionally, it
              improves the individual's immune system. According to a study,
              sleep also aids in burning fat. You can find the study link at the
              bottom of this article, and you can delve deeper into the topic in
              Saber's video on the importance of sleep. Staying within the six
              and a half to eight and a half hours of sleep range each night,
              and maintaining the same waking time, significantly contributes to
              maintaining a healthy weight. People who stay up late with their
              phones or watching movies until sunrise are engaging in unhealthy
              behavior, which can harm their health. As our elders say, 'Early
              to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.'
              It's not a problem you can blame on others or tell the chef about.
              You were wishing for six and a half hours of sleep in the Darija
              language to maintain your health in fitness, but we are not
              responsible for his reaction.

            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              One of the things many of us have become addicted to in the last
              ten years is spending long hours on our phones or tablets,
              scrolling through Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, or other
              applications. This habit causes fatigue and burns fewer calories
              compared to activities that increase them, thus affecting your
              health. You can take thirty minutes from these long hours to use
              an application or watch a YouTube channel. To make sure we don't
              leave you hanging, here is a link to a full-body home workout
              without equipment.

              Moving more equals burning more.

            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              Many people have cars and motorcycles; ask them the last time they
              walked 50 meters on foot, and they might find it difficult. Those
              who don't have a vehicle might say, 'I'm not feeling well' when
              you suggest going somewhere on foot. However, with a few steps,
              you can burn a significant number of calories. According to a
              scientific study by Dr. Richardson and his colleagues (you can
              find it below), regular walking with simple steps can lead to
              weight loss. They say, the more you walk, the more weight you
              lose. In another study by Professor Ed Gappmaier at the University
              of Utah, they write that even overweight individuals can achieve
              significant weight loss by walking for forty minutes four times a
              week. So, ladies, don't just stroll with your friends every five
              minutes; forty consecutive minutes are required from you. Another
              important thing, which Saber might not emphasize on his Instagram,
              is that it's better to use stairs instead of elevators. Stairs are
              crucial for burning fat and working on leg and thigh muscles,
              especially if there are many stairs. Oh, what a great idea!

              Spicy food is good for health.

              but it may not suit everyone (without going into the details).
              Here, we're talking about people who have no problem eating chili
              peppers and spicy foods in various forms, whether red, green, or
              ground. Some consider it the number 1 food for weight loss because
              it contains a chemical compound called Capsaicin, which helps
              maintain (increase the speed of) metabolism. In a study conducted
              by the scientist Lejeune and his team in 2003, Capsaicin was found
              to be very effective in oxidizing stored fat in the body (it
              literally melts fat). Not only that, this compound also contains
              Vitamin C, which helps boost your immune system. If you have no
              objection, consider adding spicy foods to your diet. But be
              cautious, as spicy food can make you feel hungry.

            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              It is well-known worldwide that sodas or energy drinks, and even
              alcoholic beverages, are unhealthy because they contain a lot of
              sugars and unnecessary calories that don't contribute to
              fulfilling your daily nutritional needs, unlike fruits and
              vegetables. Sweet sodas are strongly linked to obesity. There are
              other alternatives such as fruit or vegetable juice, and even
              sugar-free drinks. A crucial question to consider is whether
              sugar-free sodas are truly calorie-free or just part of
              advertising? In this video, Saber conducts an experiment with a
              sugar-free soda, and you will find out the answer!

              Eat in moderation and choose your food wisely.

            <p className='text-gray-500 text-lg mt-3'>
              "One day Saber mentioned that he eats in small tablespoons, and I
              didn't quite understand its significance until I found it in an
              American study conducted by Wansink & Kim. You can find the link
              below. They conducted their research on popcorn, stating that
              using a larger spoon contributes to eating more, even if you don't
              particularly enjoy the food. It tricks you into consuming more,
              and they suggest that, for lunch, you should consider using a
              smaller spoon to avoid overeating. Overindulgence is not a good
              idea, but don't stress over the excess food you've put on your
              plate. Speaking of food, the composition of your plate should
              include 50% non-starchy vegetables, 30% nutrient-rich protein, and
              20% fruits and dietary fats. And don't forget to stay hydrated by
              drinking water throughout the day.

              Finally, these are just simple steps for an average person to burn
              and avoid the intake of a significant amount of excess calories
              that contribute to obesity. Before we move on to someone with
              English skills who enjoys reading books, I recommend this
              excellent book by Jonathan Bailor called 'The Calorie Myth.' It
              delves into the concept of calorie myths.
